## Introduction
The research master _Brain and Cognitive Sciences_ is predicated on the notion that exciting stuff happens if scientists operate at the boundaries between different fields. But what is needed for good, interdisciplinary research? Which skills and attitudes does it require? Which tools and best practices are there to pursue interdisciplinarity? And what _is_ interdisciplinarity in the first place? _Special Topic in Cognitive Science_ aims to teach you how to work on research questions that require input from different fields. This means that the course pays a lot of attention to the _process_ of such research, with you and your fellow students bringing in the substance. This process is illustrated as you work on a 'Special Topic', a big question that is related to brain and cognitive science. In the end, you should be able to check the following boxes:

|Element|Description|
|:-:|:--|
|Knowledge & Understanding|<ul><li>- [ ] You have arrived at an interdisciplinary understanding of the research addressing your 'Special Topic'.<li>- [ ] You can explain the differences between interdisciplinarity, multidisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity.<li>- [ ] You can enumerate the most important pitfalls in scientific research.<li>- [ ] You can explain the difference between causal and constitutive explanations.<li>- [ ] You can explain the differences and similarities between different fields within brain and cognitive sciences.</ul>|
|Applying Knowledge & Understanding|<ul><li>- [ ] You can create a causal map of any system of interest.<li> - [ ] You can use causal maps to critically interrogate explanations.</ul>
|Making judgments|<ul><li>- [ ] You can evaluate the quality of published research, even in fields just ouside of your own.<li>- [ ] You can assess to what extent your own expertise can contribute to answering a question, and to what extent different expertise is required.</ul>
|Communication Skills|<ul><li>- [ ] You are able to establish common ground within a multidisciplinary team.<li>- [ ] You are able to ask experts and team members for specific information that aids your knowledge and understanding of a different field.<li>- [ ] You are able to explain all elements of your interdisciplinary research, including elements that might rely on fields outside of your expertise.</ul>
|Learning Skills|<ul><li>- [ ] You can manage your time on a prolonged project effectively.<li>- [ ] You can seek out information via literature and experts.<li>- [ ] You can logically argue to what extent different sources answer your research question.</ul>|


That is a lot stuff, and not all of it is very _measurable_, so we brought them down to a handful of learning objectives.

## Learning Objectives
1. Collaborate effectively with scientists who have different disciplinary perspectives
2. Formulate scientifically informed answers or solutions for questions posed by scientists or non-academic partners
3. Integrate multidiscipinary insights to arrive at an interdisciplinary explanation
4. Reflect on the scientific process and your role in this process
