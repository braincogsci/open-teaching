## Introduction
The research master _Brain and Cognitive Sciences_ is predicated on the notion that exciting stuff happens if scientists operate at the boundaries between different fields. But what is needed for good, interdisciplinary research? Which skills and attitudes does it require? Which tools and best practices are there to pursue interdisciplinarity? And what _is_ interdisciplinarity in the first place? _Special Topic in Cognitive Science_ aims to teach you how to work on research questions that require input from different fields. This means that the course pays a lot of attention to the _process_ of such research, with you and your fellow students bringing in the substance. This process is illustrated as you work on a 'Special Topic', a big question that is related to brain and cognitive science. In the end, you should be able to check the following boxes:

|Element|Description|
|:-:|:--|
|Knowledge & Understanding|<ul><li>- [ ] You have arrived at an interdisciplinary understanding of the research addressing your 'Special Topic'.<li>- [ ] You can explain the differences between interdisciplinarity, multidisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity.<li>- [ ] You can enumerate the most important pitfalls in interdisciplinary scientific research.<li>- [ ] You can explain the difference between causal and constitutive explanations.<li>- [ ] You can explain the differences and similarities between different fields within brain and cognitive sciences.</ul>|
|Applying Knowledge & Understanding|<ul><li>- [ ] You can create a causal map of any system of interest.<li> - [ ] You can use causal maps to critically interrogate explanations.</ul>
|Making judgments|<ul><li>- [ ] You can evaluate the quality of published research, even in fields just ouside of your own.<li>- [ ] You can assess to what extent your own expertise can contribute to answering a question, and to what extent different expertise is required.</ul>
|Communication Skills|<ul><li>- [ ] You are able to establish common ground within a multidisciplinary team.<li>- [ ] You are able to ask experts and team members for specific information that aids your knowledge and understanding of a different field.<li>- [ ] You are able to explain all elements of your interdisciplinary research, including elements that might rely on fields outside of your expertise.</ul>
|Learning Skills|<ul><li>- [ ] You can manage your time on a prolonged project effectively.<li>- [ ] You can seek out information via literature and experts.<li>- [ ] You can logically argue to what extent different sources answer your research question.</ul>|


That is a lot stuff, and not all of it is very _measurable_, so we brought them down to a handful of learning objectives that we can assess.

## Learning Objectives and Assessment

|Learning Objective|Assessment|
|--:|:---:|
|Collaborate effectively with scientists who have different disciplinary perspectives|Pressure Cooker, written report|
|Formulate scientifically informed answers or solutions for questions posed by scientists or non-academic partners|Prototype presentations, written report|
|Critically assess scientific sources|Critical review, written report|
|Integrate multidiscipinary insights to arrive at an interdisciplinary explanation|Written report|

## Teaching Methods
You will reach these objectives by working on the answer to a big question (your special topic), together with two or three other students. You can choose the big question from a shortlist that is provided at the start of the course. All of the questions on that list lie at the intersection of different disciplines. During the process of answering the question, you will collect and discuss literature, meet with experts, pitch preliminary answers, write a peer review of a key paper you found during your research and finally write a summative report of your project.

### Design Thinking
The development of the answer will be structured around a development cycle called Design Thinking. Design Thinking is a useful approach when you are venturing into new territories. It consists of five different phases.

![5 steps of design thinking](https://writtenbykhadijah.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/dt.jpg)

The early stage, **empathizing**, corresponds to getting a good idea of the landscape of knowledge related to your Special Topic. This means desk research via journals and other sources, organizing insights, finding differences and similarities between different disciplines, interviewing experts and visualizing your findings. This is something you will be doing in the run-up to December. During this time, you will also draft an Integration Plan (a document that summarizes how you will bring different disciplines together) and will critically assess the work of fellow students.

The middle stages are **define**, **ideate** and **prototype**. You will go through these phases in January, during intensive weeks known as the Pressure Cooker. In the define stage, you will narrow down your research question. You will also decide with your tutor which form your final product for the course will take. In the ideate stage, you will start dreaming up this final product, using a variety of tools that will be at your disposal.  Then, finally, in the prototype stage you will present your ideas to a panel of experts, who will give feedback for you. 

From February to April, you will tweak and improve your prototype during the **test** phase, in which you create a final product with your tutor as a mentor to check on your progress. In this test phase, you will also write a critical review of one of the research papers you have been using.

|Design Thinking Phase|Goals|Activities|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Empathize|<ul><li>Explore available literature.<li>Think about different disciplinary perspectives and their relationships, to address your special topic.<li>Speak to experts in different disciplines about your (and their!) ideas.<li>Create a Causal Map to visualize your understanding of your system of interest.</ul>|Lectures, tutorials, expert meetings |
|Define|<ul><li>Determine your specific research question and output format.<li>Decide which disciplines (at least three) will contribute to answering the question.</ul>|Pressure Cooker|
|Ideate|<ul><li>Reflect on the knowledge you have gathered and create an answer to the question you are investigating.</ul>|Pressure Cooker|
|Prototype|<ul><li>Create a preliminary answer to the research question.<li>Discuss your answer with experts.<li>Gain feedback on your current ideas.</ul>|Pressure cooker |
|Test|<ul><li><li>Create a final product that clearly conveys your (substantiated) answer to your research question</ul>|Progress meetings, tutorials|

## Learning activities
The structure of the course is such that you are guided through working on your project. You can find a detailed structure of the course on https://datanose.nl/#course[88722].

|Activity|Hours|
|:--:|:--:|
|Lectures|10|
|Tutorials|32|
|Pressure Cooker|40|
|Symposium|3|
|Self-study and Assignments|36|
|Project|47|
|Total|168|

## Attendance
Your attendance is required during the tutorials, progress meetings and pressure cooker. You can miss at most 20% of those mandatory activities. Presence during all other activities is strongly recommended.

## Assessment
While you are working on your project, different milestones will be assessed to determine your final grade.

|Milestone|Deadline|Weight|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Integration Plan|November 9, 2020|10%|
|Critical Analysis of Causal Map|December 14, 2020|10%|
|Pressure Cooker Pitch|January 29, 2021|15%|
|Critical Review|February 23, 2021|15%|
|Final Product|April 19, 2021|50%|

More details on the assignments can be found at the course Canvas page.

## Partial grades and resits
*STICS* runs through a large portion of the first year and doing a resit for the full course is therefore a large investment. Students who are unable to attend parts of the course due to personal circumstances should contact the study advisor via studieadviseur-iis@uva.nl. For those students, alternative assignments may be issued to compensate for attendance gaps.

# Literature
All literature will be cited on Canvas.
