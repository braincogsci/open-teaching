# The Big Question

In the course _Special Topic in Cognitive Science_, student will work in groups to arrive at an interdisciplinary analysis of a specific topic that is relevant to Brain and Cognitive Sciences. To arrive at their answer, they will search through literature, talk to experts and make progress via tutorials that offer them instruments to understand and recombine insights from different fields. While doing so, they will learn how to work as interdisciplinary scientists.

Central to this journey are the Big Questions, important issues that are raised by scientists who work on cognition and neuroscience. These questions are:

* Broad enough so that they can be approached through different angles (students have the liberty to reformulate or reframe the question)
* In need of an answer that integrates views from multiple disciplines (e.g. biology, psychology and philosophy)
* Answerable (even if only in a preliminary or partial way) using existing sources
* Challenging, in the sense that answering them requires creative and careful thought

# What we need
We would like to ask you think of such a question and to create a short video (of about 10 minutes) in which you:

* Introduce yourself and the Big Question, as well as the reasons why you find the question important
* Suggest how different specific disciplines could in principle help to answer the question
* Mention any important disagreements in the literature that you are aware of with regards to the question

On top of that, we would also like to invite you to see what the students come up with. They will be presenting their work on January 29, 2021, in the afternoon.
