# Integration Plan
Integrating different disciplinary perspectives is the cornerstone of interdisciplinary research. The Integration Plan is a description of how you want to achieve that. It consists of the following components.

1. Your (adapted) Big Question, including a justification of why there is academic and/or societal interest in this question.
2. An enumeration of at least three disciplines that are valuable when answering the  question, including a summary of important insights from those disciplines (including citations).
3. For every important insight, a section describing what the perspectives from the other disciplines on this insight are, if any. Sometimes they will match the insight (convergence), sometimes they will oppose it (tension).
4. A visualization of the system that is relevant to your research question, using the Causal Map approach.
5. An overview of which tensions between disciplines you should still receive and which connections on your Causal Map still need more elucidation via literature and/or experts.


# Critical Analysis of Causal Map

## Introduction
In the lecture by Vincent Tijms, we discussed that a (pretty banalized) version of critical thinking can be reduced to the following basic questions:

1. What?
2. How? 
3. Really?

The first question is meant to ensure that definitions are clear and precise, the second question is used to ascertain a mechanistic understanding of whatever is being claimed and the third question is used to prompt alternative explanations. Posing these questions repeatedly under different guises is helpful to analyze a statement.

We have also discussed how a critical dialogue can circumvent the "cognitive immune system", which is biased against persuasion by others and biased towards prior convictions.

In this assignment, you will use the critical dialogue method to examine the causal map of another project group. You will also be questioned about your own causal map by another group. The form of this will be a sort of talk show: students from your and from another group will be seated at a table with the rest of the group as audience and with your very own tutor as moderator. Additionally, you will  write a short commentary on the causal map of the other project group.

## Prepare for two roles
Your group will engage in two rounds of questioning: in one round your group will *ask* questions about another causal map and in another round your group will *answer* questions about your own causal map. During the tutorial in which the rounds take place, your tutor will pick which representatives from your group will engage in which round, so make sure you are prepared for both roles!

## The role of the moderator
The tutor will be present to ensure flow of the conversation at the table, and to make sure that enough questions are being asked, in a clear manner. Don't lean onto the tutor, though: the moderator is like a driving instructor who should intervene as little as possible. 

## Structure of the talk show
To begin with, the questioned group (A) will introduce their research question and causal map (on a slide). They are given the opportunity to run through the causal map. This will take at most 5 minutes. After this, the questioning group (B) has 15 minutes to ask critical questions, and group A is supposed to answer these questions.

Tip for group A: Make sure you consider the critical questions in advance, so that you have your answers ready. If group B asks questions that are very open-ended (e.g. 'could any of the causal connections shown in your map be different?'), don't make your answer equally vague. Instead, answer the question for a concrete case. Your goal as group A is to explain your research question, causal map and findings as best as you can, but also to stay open to new insights.

Tip for group B: avoid offering advice or your own explanations, and try to encourage group A to be increasingly complete and precise. Feel free to jump back and forward between the different types of questions and try to make the conversation flow as naturally as possible. Your goal as group B is to understand group A the best you can and to encourage their thinking.

During the discussion, the moderator will score how well group A and B are playing their respective roles. 

## Scoring tables critical interview
For each interview, the tutor will track how well the conversation is going. Group A is scored for their answering, while group B is scored for the questioning. Each of the critical questions is scored separately.

The tutor will also steer away group B from asking leading questions.

| Question | Purpose | A | B |
 | :---: | :------------: | :--: |  :--: |
 | What? | Elucidate key concepts from RQ or causal map | ⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪ |⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪  | 
 | How? | Explain the nature causal links | ⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪ | ⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪ | 
 Really? | Consider alternative explanations or missing information | ⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪ | ⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪ |

The total amount of points determines the grade for this assignment, via the following table:

Score| Grade
-------- | -----
3 - 6| 5
7 - 9| 6
10 - 11 | 7
12 - 13| 8
14| 9
15 | 10

## Critical commentary
After you have had the critical discussions, you are expected to write a short (1 page) critical commentary on the causal map of your buddy group. In this commentary, make sure you do the following:

* Clearly describe the problem that your buddy group addresses
* Argue what two strengths and weaknesses are of the way their causal map describes the system under consideration
* Make note of any elements in the causal map that you think your buddy group is overlooking and should explore more deeply

Please stay civil and constructive in your critical commentary! The commentary will be graded by your tutor on the basis of how well-argued, constructive and relevant your criticism is. 

# Pressure Cooker Pitch
At the end of the Pressure Cooker, you will have arrived a prototype for an answer to the research question you have been working on. This can take several forms: a policy advise, a scientific report, a mock-up of a product or another form that fits your project. You are asked to present your protoype during a 15 minute presentation, in which you address:

* The Big Question that inspired your research question
* Why you went with your specific research question
* What the important considerations are to answer the questions
* What your (preliminary) answer to the question is

# Critical review
The critical attitude is a central part of what it means to be a scientist. It does not mean that you should approach information negatively, however. On the contrary, critical assessment is at its most useful if it's done constructively. It means that you should carefully consider a line of argumentation, examine its logic and see if it fits with all the evidence available to you. It means that you should ask the right questions to make sure that a given piece of reasoning is solid. 

For this assignment you will play the role of a scientist who is peer reviewing a paper that was submitted to a scientific journal. You can choose a paper you have come across while researching your topic. While you are using papers that were actually already published, you will pretend they are not and you will judge whether they should be published. This is done by providing the editor of the journal with one of the following recommendations:

* Publish as is. This is saying that the paper is good as it is and that it can be published. This advice is hardly ever given in reality.
* Publish, pending minor revisions. This is saying that the paper is good and worthy of publication, but that some aspects should be improved before it is really ready to appear in print. If issues are relatively easy to fix, you can consider them minor
* Publish, pending major revisions. This is saying the research is potentially good for publication, but that there are some big issues that need to be taken care of. Big issues usually come down to doing additional control experiments, reanalyzing the data using different methods, etc.
* Reject. This means the research is either uninteresting, or so poorly done/described that it cannot be fixed in the eyes of the reviewer.

Your assignment will not be graded on the basis of whether you provide the right recommendation, but on the basis of the reasoning that you put forward, the exhaustiveness of your analysis, and the clarity with which you make your case. It's also important that you strike a professional tone: critical, but polite and constructive.

For your critical review you are allowed to assess the quality of all aspects of scientific research. A good critical review does not only identify problems with these aspects, but also gives suggestion how to improve on them. Aspects of scientific research include (note that this list is not exhaustive):

* Aim/question
* Embeddedness in existing research
* Operationalisation
* Design/methods
* Assumptions
* Statistical analysis
* Choice and quality of graphs and figures
* Limitations mentioned
* Conclusions drawn
* Implications
* Quality of writing

N.B. You could review the aspects separately and/or by reviewing the relation and coherence of these aspects.

Keep in mind that publication in a journal does not mean a research article is beyond criticism - or beyond the question whether publication of the article is warranted. Even after a paper has been published scientists argue about the caveats in a research (in letters to the journal, which are usually published as well) or whether an article should (not) have made it into the journal. 

You are expected to:

1. Write a 1 to 2 page letter to the editor of a journal, in which you advise on publication of a selected research paper;
2. Summarize the main findings discussed in the research paper;
3. Assess the quality of the chosen research paper, by carefully analyzing each section;
4. Address the content, structure, style and data presentation of the research paper;
5. List weaknesses of the research paper, numbered and segmented into major/minor issues;
6. Clearly argue what the strengths and weaknesses of the paper are;
7. Maintain a polite, constructive tone (include suggestions);
8. Include a recommendation in the letter that reflects your assessment.

# Final product
You will close off STICS with a final product that helps to answer the Big Question you started with. You have a lot of freedom to choose the form of this final product: it could be a literature review, it could be a policy advise, it could be an extended research proposal, or something else that you find fits well with your question (make sure to discuss your choice with your tutor, though!).

The final product will be graded on:

* Interdisciplinarity: does the work bring together different perspectives into an integrated whole?
* Academic quality: does the product display a critical understanding of the subject matter? Does it ground claims in empirical/rational arguments?
* Effectiveness: does the product indeed address the Big Question raised at the start of the course?
* Style and format: is the product well-produced (e.g. good writing, layout).
